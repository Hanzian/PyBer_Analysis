# PyBer_Analysis

## Delivrable 1

In the firt step of our activity is to check if we've imported the dataset correctly and if the new colunm " school_budget" is displaying.

## Delivrable 2

in this section, we started by cleaning the dataset, checking the property of each colums and replace the string value by numerical.

## Delivrable 3

After cleaning, we had to analyse our dataset by displaying the summaty statistic, showing the mean of the math score and the minimum value of the reading score for all the students

## Delivrable 4

In this step, the formula allow us to sort the dataset to take out information about grade, to make a comparaison between reading score and math score

## Delivrable 5

The analysis of this section allow us to get the average budget for each school type, the total number of students per school and the average math scores for each combination of grade and school type.

For a better analyse we could display the school with the best result in math score and reading score by grade
